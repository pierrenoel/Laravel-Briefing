## The most important folders to keep in mind

* Models are in the **app/Models** folder
* Controllers are in the **app/Http/Controllers** folder
* Views are in the **resources/views** folder
* Migrations are in the **database/migrations** folder

Remain that to add some style and some javascript, you need to place them in the **public** folder!
